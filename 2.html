<<h2> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target ="_blank" title ="빅데이터위키"> Big data </a> is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.</h2>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">
Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem."[3] Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on."[4]
</p>
<p style="margin-top:145px;"> Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[5] connectomics,
<br><br>complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research.
